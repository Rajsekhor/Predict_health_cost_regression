# Predict_health_cost_regression

This is a project provided by [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

In this model, we were given a dataset that contains information about different people including their healthcare costs and we were able to use the data to predict healthcare costs based on new data.

To build the model, I took reference from multiple sites and project of fellow peers.

In this challenge, you will predict healthcare costs using a regression algorithm.

You are given a dataset that contains information about different people including their healthcare costs. Use the data to predict healthcare costs based on new data.
